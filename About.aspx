    <p style="color:black; font-size:24px;">About Groovy Grounds and the Database</p>

    <p style="text-align:left;color:#0B3861;">
   Groovy Grounds is a quaint coffee house and cafe located in Dyersville, IA.  It is owned and 

operated by Anne Reitzler and Mary Wessels.  For this project, our contact is Anne Reitzler.  

Groovy Grounds Coffee House opened its doors in 2004, serving a menu made up of specialty 

coffee drinks and cafe-style lunch items.  Over the last several years, the business has 

expanded their services to include musical entertainment, catering, a wine bar and other private 

on-site events.  They also sell Groovy merchandise such as bulk coffee beans, coffee mugs and 

Groovy apparel. </p>  

<p style="text-align:left;color:#0B3861;"> Groovy Grounds' owners are focused on creating more of an online presence for their business 

and potentially opening other Groovy Grounds locations.  Up to this point, their online presence 

has been limited to a Facebook page.  They have a website currently under construction and 

see the need for a database to support the new website and other vital functions of the 

business.  This database will by no means be the complete end product needed to facilitate 

everything that Groovy Grounds' owners intend on doing in the future, but it could be scaled up 

or adapted down the line. This database will be used primarily in-house by employees to track 

orders and events.</p>
